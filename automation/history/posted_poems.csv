The dice of drowned men's bones he saw bequeath
An embassy.  Their numbers as he watched,
Beat on the dusty shore and were obscured.

And wrecks passed without sound of bells,
The calyx of death's bounty giving back
A scattered chapter, livid hieroglyph,
The portent wound in corridors of shells.

Then in the circuit calm of one vast coil,
Its lashings charmed and malice reconciled,
Frosted eyes there were that lifted altars;
And silent answers crept across the stars.

Compass, quadrant and sextant contrive
No farther tides... High in the azure steeps
Monody shall not wake the mariner.
This fabulous shadow only the sea keeps."
2026-01-04,"Of all the women whom I know it is
Alcestis I most passionately admire,
Who died for an unworthy man, being
Sure that love was death
And nothing more. Nothing is pure in
Nature. Not childhood, nor infancy
Nor the moment of begetting with its
Too many images. Uneasy in my
Labor, uneasy in my rest. In love
Distressed; and in my loneliness quite lost—
I walk out in this storm, as in a mind
Deranged but not unclean;
Alcestis is my dream, who died forever
And then rose—for three days mute and strange."
